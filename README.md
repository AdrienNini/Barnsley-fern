# Barnsley-fern

## Inspiration

Code based on the [Coding Challenge #108](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFugGF1URNo&t=14s) of Daniel Shiffman.

The original code is written is [Processig](https://processing.org), a JAVA based programming environment. I adapted it in Javascript with the [P5.js library](https://p5js.org) and [Jquery](https://jquery.com) and Refactored the code to handle different versions of the algorithm. 

## Explainations

According to Wikipedia, the Barnsley fern is a mathematically generated pattern that can be reproducible at any magnification or reduction. For further information, I invite you to read the [Barnsley fern wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnsley_fern).
